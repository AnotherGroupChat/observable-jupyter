   Why Observable-Jupyter?
   ^^^

   **Observable for the Python Community**
        Gives Python users access to Observable's vast archives of community built data visualizations

   **Works without JavaScript**
        Although Observable uses JavaScript, JavaScript is not required for any of Observable-Jupyter's “essential” functionality.

   **Configurable**
        Visualizations can be configured using Python.
